# Smart-Parking-System-using-MATLAB
Developed a SMART Parking System Using MATLAB for our Semester project
Smart parking management system provides solution to ever-increasing problem of vehicle
parking which is certainly an important matter of concern in this automated world. With the
increase in number of vehicles on the roadways, parking an automobile has turned out to be a
major concern for everyone. Finding a parking spot in crowded areas is a daunting task. The
Smart Parking Management System systematically regulates traffic in parking areas thus
reducing chaos and saving time.
The Smart Parking Management System is developed in MATLAB and is linked with cloud via
ThingSpeak where the inflow and outflow of traffic is recorded and stored. The project is
implemented using an Arduino UNO microcontroller, coupled to a servo motor and a series of
LEDs used as indicators in the parking zone. The entire hardware assembly is interfaced to
MATLAB UI, an application which includes a graphical representation of the entire system. The
system can be operated directly from this application. When the system is activated, available
number of parking spots is displayed on the screen. If spots are available, the driver presses the
enter button, the signal changes from red to green color and the servo motor barrier is lifted to
allow the passage of the vehicle. Once the vehicle is parked, the barrier closes and again the red
signal is turned on displaying the current number of available spots in the specified parking zone.
Consequently, when a car exits, the driver presses the exit switch, the servo motor barrier is
lifted, red signal turns green and the car is allowed to exit. After departure, the count resets,
barrier is closed, green signal changes to red and the current available spots are displayed in the
application.
A parking zone equipped with a Smart Parking System, facilitates automatic control and
synchronization of incoming and outgoing traffic. Moreover, the data from the cloud enables one
to record and track the behavior of traffic over a specific period. This provides a hassle-free and
swift parking experience to the drivers.
